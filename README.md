### **Transportation System** 🚍  

#### **Overview**  
This project is a **Java-based Transportation System** that allows users to register, log in, and manage trips. The system supports three types of users: **Passengers, Employees (Managers & Drivers)**. It utilizes **file-based storage** to manage user data, trip details, and vehicle information.

#### **Team Leadership**  
This project was developed by a team, I was the team leader. The primary goal was to build a simple yet efficient transportation management system using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.
